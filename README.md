# Network anomaly detection using adversarial deep learning

"The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemyâ€™s not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable." The Art of War, Sun Tzu.

## Context
   
"Security is a journey, not a destination". Network architectures are complex and face ever-changing threatening environments. Ciphers, that until a few years ago would take decades to decipher, can now be broken in a few minutes using High-Performance Computing (HPC).
Malicious agents are always trying to find and exploit vulnerabilities creating new attacks that are bound to become more and more sophisticated with the advent of artificial intelligence technologies. 
It is, therefore, necessary to fight back with the same weapons. In such a context, this project aims to develop network anomalies detection methods using Adversarial Deep Learning to identify the occurrence of attacks.
	
Detecting network anomalies using deep learning techniques requires large sets of data. Just as there is no knowledge without information, there is no deep learning without data. Unfortunately, network flow datasets are usually not publicly available and not shared with the research community to comply with privacy concerns. Furthermore,  datasets which contain realistic user behaviour and up-to-date attack scenarios are very scarce.

The proposed work will address the sparse availability of data by building a generative model responsible for producing large sets of network flow data while improving the detection of anomalies and disguised attacks.
