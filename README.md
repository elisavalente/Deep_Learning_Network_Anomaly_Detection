# Network anomaly detection using adversarial deep learning

"The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemyâ€™s not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable." 
The Art of War, Sun Tzu.

## Context
   
The proposed work will address the sparse availability of data by building a generative model responsible for producing large sets of network flow data while improving the detection of anomalies and disguised attacks.
